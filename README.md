# Hophead Stub Web Application - MKIII

Minimum viable version of the stub application made for Hophead.


// Current Concerns //
1. API calls are external and done manually because no server side configurations are done :)
2. No HTML -> PDF functionality implemented to convert HTML DOM content to PDF files. This is required to download the stubs in PDF Format
